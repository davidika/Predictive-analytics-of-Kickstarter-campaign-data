# Predicting Kickstarter campaign success

This Project, Project 2, continues from Project 1 (analysis of kickstarter campaign data, found [here](https://github.com/davidika/Analysis-of-Kickstarter-campaign-data) and observes the same dataset.

As mentioned in Project 1, the chosen dataset is titled “Funding Successful Projects on Kickstarter” and can be found on Kaggle here, uploaded by user Lathwal

The dataset was released by Kickstarter, a company that connects community investors with start-up projects in an ‘all-or-nothing’ fashion: The user sets a goal for their project, and if it falls short by even $1, zero funding is attained.

Whilst Project 1 explored and visualised the data, Project 2 aims to address the initial business objective set by Kickstarter: to help predict whether a project will be successfully funded. Classification and clustering methods will be used to achieve this.
